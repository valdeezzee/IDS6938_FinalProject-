### Title

Digging in the dirt - with Virtual Reality


### Abstract

Todays archaeology is a very divers and interdisciplinary science, which uses more and more technological devices and support to be more exact, detailed and accurate. One of the main methods in archaeology to generate data and findings is the excavation. To ensure that the data gathered at excavations are standardized, comparable, and suitable for scientific analysis, there are numereous guidelines, work processes and documentation technologies, depending on the current task and location (forest, urban environment, mining underground, inside building-complexes). 
GPS devices and specialized measurement equipment (tachymeters) are now used for excavation surveying and mapping. Ideally, the measurement data can be further refined, improved or supplemented with 2D or 3D laser-scanners and other specially adapted photographic documentation measures (including aerial photography). 
With the inplementation of Virtual Reality (VR) technology in conjunction with GPS devices and spatial recognition software implemented in the VR technology, excavation site mapping could be set-up easier and faster. Especially for time-critical exploration or limited funding operations (limited equipment, remote location), VR technology could offer a well balanced and an "accurate enough" approach for setting up the required prerequisites. 


### Problem Statement

Excavation sites have to be mapped accuratly to scientically analyze the findings and to be able to reconstruct the actual outlay of the findings in a standardized fashion. Setting up a excavation site base grid, depending on task and environment, to start the excavation process is time consuming and requires highly accurate, specialized and expensive equipment. The necessary processes are time consuming and require training and expertise in the use of the specialized equipment.

Depending on the excavation site and technique selected for the task, it is not always possible to adapt the local excavation site grid to the underlying coordinates grid. Therefore, the grid has to be measured and put into reference with a standardized system so that the findings/generated data can be recorded, analyzed and reconstructed.   

Additionally, excavation sites can be local or non-conformal to a traditional grid due to location or legal constrains. Still, an accurate documentation has to be ensured. Measuring the coordinates used to be timeconsuming, as either GPS was not available yet or the necessary accuracy (within cm/less than an inch) could not be provided by (civil/available) the available GPS ccordinates. 

From a given, accurate coordinate, a grid has to be established and meaasured, usually with the help of the mentioned equipemtn above or e.g. with measuring band 


### Background

![Measuring step 1+2](https://github.com/valdeezzee/IDS6938_FinalProject-/blob/master/Ausgrabung/measuring1.png)

In the past, correct and accurate measuring and geolocating a finding or setting up a grid to work with was a time consuming effort. Usually, the use of standardized and official measuring points/markers where the prerequisite to start from. With the use of a Tachymetre, the actual claim or excavation site was measured and marked.

Further points were triangulated to be used to again define the own position. There are usually at least 3 points needed to define the own position within the needed accuracy.

From the known, triangulated position, findings and special areas could be mapped and marked, exact postions generated. It is a lengthy process, which needs specialized equipment (Tachymetre) and special training to use it. While it may still be an important skill for archaeologists to be able to use and understand a Tachymetre, the use of GPS based coordinate generation is much easier and can be used in any area of the world (where the different satellite navigation systems are available).


Satellite based navigation is currently the most modern way of measuring and defining exact coordinates. In order to achive the necessary accuracy, the available GPS data has to be compared to a known, exactly measured point/coordinate and its GPS indication. Civil available satellite based navigation systems have a certain (artificially injected) inaccuracy, which can be compensated with the introduction of the second, known coordinate (e.g. survey points) and its satellite based coordinate. This process is called (pseudo-) differential GPS and can significantly improve the accuracy of any satellite based navigation system from about 15m (civil GPS accuracy, depending on the location on earth) to ideally up to 10 cm (4inch).
