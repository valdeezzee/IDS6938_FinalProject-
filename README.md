Title

Digging in the dirt - with Virtual Reality


Abstract

Todays archaeology is a very divers and interdisciplinary science, which uses more and more technological devices and support to be more exact, detailed and accurate. One of the main methods in archaeology to generate data and findings is the excavation. To ensure that the data gathered at excavations are standardized, comparable, and suitable for scientific analysis, there are numereous guidelines, work processes and documentation technologies, depending on the current task and location (forest, urban environment, mining underground, inside building-complexes). 
GPS devices and specialized measurement equipment (tachymeters) are used for excavation surveying and mapping. Ideally, the measurement data can be further refined, improved or supplemented with 2D or 3D laser-scanners and other specially adapted photographic documentation measures (including aerial photography). 
With the inplementation of Virtual Reality (VR) technology in conjunction with GPS devices and spatial recognition software implemented in the VR technology, excavation site mapping could be set-up easier and faster. Especially for time-critical exploration or limited funding operations (limited equipment, remote location), VR technology could offer a well balanced and an "accurate enough" approach for setting up the required prerequisites. 


Problem Statement

Excavation sites have to be mapped accuratly to scientically analyze the findings and to be able to reconstruct the actual outlay of the findings in a standardized fashion. Setting up a base grid, depending on task and environment, to start the excavation process is time consuming and requires highly accurate, specialized and expensive equipment. The necessary processes are time consuming and require trainign and expertise in the use of the specialized equipment.
